# Mirrored Documents

Some of the official P2 documentation is hosted on Google Docs and suffer for it. The interface is slow, it's easy to accidentially edit the doc by typing into it and by default vandalism from other users is visible to you, too.

Due to this, we have decided to mirror some documents:

 - [P2 Silicon Documentation](p2silicon.html)
 - [P2 Instruction Table](../p2_optable.html)
