# Hub FIFO

Each Cog possesses a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue that can be used to read or write sequential data from/to [Hub RAM](hubmem.html).

It can either be used to feed the [Streamer](streamer.html), to execute code from Hub RAM (HubExec) or manually using the RFxxxx and WRxxxx instructions.

## Control Instructions

<%=p2instrinfo('rdfast')%>
RDFAST prepares the FIFO queue to read from the address given in **S**ource. Additionally, if **D**estination[13:0] is non-zero, it is used as a count of 64-byte blocks after which the FIFO read address wraps back around. If this is used, the address in **S**ource must be long-aligned.

Normally, RDFAST will block while the FIFO completes any pending writes and fills up with read data, but if **D**estination[31] is set, it doesn't. Attempting to use the FIFO while it is not yet ready will cause zeroes to be read. In the usual case (no pending WRFAST data), the FIFO is guaranteed to be ready after **13** cycles.

**SILICON ERRATA:** When using RDFAST with **D**estination[31] set, using other, (non-FIFO) Hub RAM read/write instructions while the FIFO is not yet ready can [cause issues](errata.html#rdfast-startup-bug).

**TODO reword more detail**


<%=p2instrinfo('wrfast')%>
WRFAST prepares the FIFO queue to write to the address given in **S**ource. Additionally, if **D**estination[13:0] is non-zero, it is used as a count of 64-byte blocks after which the FIFO read address wraps back around. If this is used, the address in **S**ource must be long-aligned.

Normally, WRFAST will block while the FIFO completes any pending writes, but if **D**estination[31] is set, it doesn't. Attempting to use the FIFO while it is not yet ready may result in garbled data.

**TODO reword more detail**

<%=p2instrinfo('fblock')%>
FBLOCK sets the next wrap address and length for the FIFO queue.

**TODO**


<%=p2instrinfo('getptr')%>
GETPTR gets the current FIFO address (from/to which the next data will be read/written) into **D**estination.

**TODO: I think this only works right with RFxxxx/WFxxxx and XBYTE? (i.e. not with streamer or hubexec)**
